There's a [github repository](https://github.com/zet23t/tinyduinogame-playground) where I upload my code to.

I have decided to use branches for the projects: 

* The [master](https://github.com/zet23t/tinyduinogame-playground) branch contains the core code
* The [asteroids](https://github.com/zet23t/tinyduinogame-playground/tree/asteroids) branch is the asteroids project I am working on

The reason why I use branches over different repositories is no particular reason at all. It was easier to set up and I suspect
that the projects need to get synced every once in a while. I might change this in the future. 

I have not settled with any License yet. I am in favor of the MIT license though.
