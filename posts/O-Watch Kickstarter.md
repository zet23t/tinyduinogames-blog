Have you heard of the [o-watch, a 3d printable smartwatch for kids](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/snair/o-watch-a-3d-printable-smartwatch-kit-for-kids)? It showcases the next generation of tiny duino processor boards: 48mHz processor, 256kb flash and 32kb RAM - so 8 times faster and memory as well as 16 times more RAM. Buffering the entire screen (even with 16bit) is therefore possible - must be a cool base for quite sophisticated games!
