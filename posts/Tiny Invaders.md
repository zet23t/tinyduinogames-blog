The source is available [on github](https://github.com/zet23t/tinyduinogame-playground/tree/tiny_invaders).

Special: It works with the tiny screen buttons as well as with the tiny game pad, depending on what buttons are used to start the game.

Thanks goes to [InnoGames](https://corporate.innogames.com/de/) for allowing me
to develop this game during my work time as an InnoDay project.
