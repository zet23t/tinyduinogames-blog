I am still trying to create a case for the tinyduino:

<img class="center" src="/inc/posts/casedesign-03-backside.jpg" />
<img class="center" src="/inc/posts/casedesign-04-frontside.jpg" />

It's looking ok so far I think. Even though I have plenty of 3d modelling 
experience, it's more difficult than expected to take mechanical properties 
such as material thickness or movement of parts into account. I also only have 
a rough idea how the parts should be assembled - I'll have to slice the body I am
making now in the end. Though I also have to take care of placing switches in a 
way that they work properly. I don't know how much 3d printing of those parts will 
cost - maybe 30â‚¬? Will have to see ...
