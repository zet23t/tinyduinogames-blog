I've took "measures" and now I have the Game Kit's shield assembly in 3D:

It's the first step to make a case for the thing so that it looks more "finished". While 
I've been creating some very few 3D print designs in the past, this one is the first 
that I'll try to do for something functional. 

I'm really tired of the current state of my device and I want a proper casing as soon as 
possible! Hopefully pressing buttons will become less painful.

Apart from that - you might notice that the USB shield is between the joystick and the
screen. This isn't how it was intended I believe, however, this way I can still press 
the screen buttons - at least two of them quite conveniently. I hope to make use of 
that.
