I crafted a new game:

It's TINY INVADERS! You can shoot down the invaders and see an awesome win screen or a devastating game over screen. 

You can get the source code here: [github.com/zet23t/tinyduinogame-playground/tree/tiny_invaders](https://github.com/zet23t/tinyduinogame-playground/tree/tiny_invaders).

Many thanks to [InnoGames](https://corporate.innogames.com/de/), the company I work at and that allows us working on pet projects every friday!
